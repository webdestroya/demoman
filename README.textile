h2. Usage

<pre>
	demo_object = Demoman.new("test/test.dem")

	# Server IP Address

	# Player who recorded the demo
	puts demo_object.player_name
	
	# The map being played
	puts demo_object.map
	
	# The game directory (dod, tf2, ...)

h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
